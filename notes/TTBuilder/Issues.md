- Converting .xml data to Python dataclasses might be a dead end
- Local timetable expects to have a [[Train Category]] but it's valid to have an ad-hoc train definition
- Maybe remove Train Category and only provide .WTT with ad-hoc train definitions?
- Move text and XML translation to a separate layer maybe
