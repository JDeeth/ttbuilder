# Timetable Builder

This will be a SimSig timetable builder, intended to allow chained timetables
to be built easily.

- Define stopping patterns
- Add services using stopping patterns with variations, or bespoke
- Define layouts of SimSig simulations e.g. Kings Cross and Peterborough
- Generate WTT files for each simulation
